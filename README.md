# CLAP-Interrogator

The CLAP-Interrogator is a brute-force audio-text-tagging algorithm based on the Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining (CLAP) algorithm. Having mined music reviews for keywords, the Interrogator associates an audio clip with those keywords to form a bag-of-phrases description of that audio clip.

## Keywords

Download the keywords with the following `curl` command.
```console
curl -L keywords.txt https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/l7cke7vb4celtyxfgi6dj/keywords.txt?rlkey=456e3ds2ihgpb7tcilfmzlotf&dl=1
```

## CLAP

CLAP (Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining) is a neural network model that learns acoustic concepts from natural language supervision. It achieves SoTA in “Zero-Shot” classification, Audio-Text & Text-Audio Retrieval, and in some datasets when finetuned.

### Setup

You are required to just install the dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` using Python 3 to get started.

If you have [conda](https://www.anaconda.com) installed, you can run the following: 

```shell
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/CLAP.git && \
cd CLAP && \
conda create -n clap python=3.8 && \
conda activate clap && \
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### CLAP weights
Request CLAP weights: [Pretrained Model \[Zenodo\]](https://zenodo.org/record/7312125#.Y22vecvMIQ9)


### Usage

Please take a look at `src/examples` for usage examples. 

- Load model
```python
from src import CLAP 

clap_model = CLAP("<PATH TO WEIGHTS>", use_cuda=False)
```

- Extract text embeddings
```python
text_embeddings = clap_model.get_text_embeddings(class_labels: List[str])
```

- Extract audio embeddings
```python
audio_embeddings = clap_model.get_audio_embeddings(file_paths: List[str])
```

- Compute similarity 
```python
sim = clap_model.compute_similarity(audio_embeddings, text_embeddings)
```

### Examples
To run zero-shot evaluation on the ESC50 dataset or a single audio file from ESC50, check `CLAP\src\`. For zero-shot evaluation on the ESC50 dataset:
```bash
> cd src && python zero_shot_classification.py
```
Output
```bash
ESC50 Accuracy: 82.6%
```
